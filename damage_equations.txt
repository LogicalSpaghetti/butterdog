Spell:
baseDamage => Powders => baseAttackSpeedSpellModifier => spellConversion => %mults => (+ raw * spellConversion) * Str * Dex

Attack damage calculation:
=>
Radiance probably applies at the start?
=>
Consus surely apply here?
=>
Powders convert a % of the neutral damage into their element, up to 100% of it.
Powders add a bit of base elemental damage to their element
=>
For spells, the damage values are then multiplied by a value based on the weapon's **base** attack speed
=>
All damage values are multiplied by the neutral conversion % and retain their type.
the sum of all damage values (before the neutral scaling) is multiplied by any elemental conversions, and becomes that type.
=>
Masteries Node base values are added to any non-zero damage values.
Mastery multipliers are applied.
Proficiencies are applied, damage is multiplicitive
=>
Armor Powder Specials add to ids as standard %s
All elemental damages are multiplied by their coresponding % multiplier
=>
Raw damage values undergo attack conversions, and are then added on.
For plain melee: (Btw the application of all raw element damage is dependent on both pre and post powder conversion) ((FIGURE OUT))
=>
Apply Skill Points, Strength, Dexterity, and any other final multipliers.
