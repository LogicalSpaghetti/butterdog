Things I don't want to forget:
Fixes:
abstract the input stuff so it doesn't repeat as much information
https://websemantics.uk/tools/image-to-data-uri-converter/
Handle Ability Tree display when no weapon has yet been provided
Fix tree clearing between reloads
    Don't generate it all with JS
Relik damage melee calculation being weird
Images flicker when first loaded
Images for other trees aren't loaded until the weapon switched, 
    if the user went offline, they aren't able to render
Features:
Offhand weapons
Consumables
Tomes
Charms :>
Custom Identification modifications
Indicate partially filled powder slots
    Indicate if it has half a powder inputted, or an invalid powder
Remove all the ids.id = 0, since they should be ignored anyway
    Removed currently because it bloats the displayed output, but keeping them would be nice for verifying calculations.
