Things I don't want to forget:
Fixes:
abstract the input stuff so it doesn't repeat as much information
https://websemantics.uk/tools/image-to-data-uri-converter/
Handle Ability Tree display when no weapon has yet been provided
Fix tree clearing between reloads
    Don't generate it all with JS
(Btw the application of all raw element damage is dependent on both pre and post powder conversion) ((FIGURE OUT))
Features:
Offhand weapons
Consumables
Tomes
Charms :>
Custom Identification modifications
Indicate partially filled powder slots
    Indicate if it has half a powder inputted, or an invalid powder

Work through the plain calculations, and just add to the JSON as-needed
Store all conversions as objects
    object name is the attack,
    names of objects within are the ability that enables them
    objects within are equal to a netwfa array.
